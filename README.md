Installation: Ensure that you have pyautogui installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already: `pip install pyautogui`
Focus on the Right Window: After the 2-second delay, make sure the window where you want the text to be sent is active and in focus. If it is not, the script will type into the wrong window.
File Contents: Ensure water.txt exists and contains the words or lines you want to spam. Each line in the text file will be treated as a separate entry.
Make sure to test it in a safe environment, such as a notepad or a dedicated chat application where you have permission to type freely.

Code Breakdown
Import Libraries: It imports the pyautogui library for automating keyboard input and the time library for adding delays.

Sleep for 2 Seconds: The time.sleep(2) line gives you two seconds to switch to the application where you want the text to be typed before the script starts.

Open the File: It opens water.txt in read mode. Make sure this file is in the same directory as your script or provide the full path to the file.

Loop Through Each Word: The for word in f: loop goes through each line (word) in the file:

`pyautogui.typewrite(word)` types out each word.
`pyautogui.press("enter")` simulates pressing the Enter key after typing each word.

Enjoy :)
